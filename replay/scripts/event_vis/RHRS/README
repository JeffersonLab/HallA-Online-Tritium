Requirements:
	Python
	vpython module
	PyROOT

The main function is RHRS_event_vis.py.  It takes one (required) argument, the path of a ROOT file to visualize events from.


Code for building an individual detector (e.g. shower, preshower) is contained in the script: 

	detector.py


In detector.py is defined a function:

	build_detector


Build functions for all detectors should be imported to the main function:

	from detector import build_detector


If the detector is dynamic (i.e., changes appearance to represent event data), the build_detector function must return the object (or array of objects) that constitute that detector.  Adjusting the appearance of detectors is done in the main function.
